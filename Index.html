<h2>44 Leaders, Legislators And Artists Sum Up Trump's First 100 Days </h2>


<p2> In October 2016, before Donald Trump defeated Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, he outlined a plan of all the things he hoped to accomplish during his first 100 days in office.</p2> <br><br>

<p2>But in the wake of failure and unfulfilled promises as his 100th day approaches, the president has changed his tune. Last week, he criticized "the ridiculous standard" of the first 100 days, slamming the deadline in one sentence.  </p2> <br><br>


<p2>To mark the milestone, HuffPost asked lawmakers, activists, lobbyists and influencers to offer their own (roughly) one-sentence takes on Trump's first 100 days. </p2> <br><br>

<p2>Here are the responses, which have been lightly edited for clarity and style:</p2>
 <br><br>
<p2>Khizr Khan, Gold Star father</p2> <br><br>

<p2>"Every action and word of Trump has [a] foul stench of political expediency and self-aggrandizing, total lack of moral compass and leadership."</p2>

<h2>North Korea attempted to test a ballistic missile early Saturday that failed shortly after launch, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reports.</h2> <br><br>


<p2>The test, according to the South Korean military, was carried out in the South Pyeongan Province at approximately 5:30 a.m.</p2> <br><br>




<p2>"North Korea fired an unidentified missile from a site in the vicinity of Bukchang in Pyeongannam-do (South Pyeongan Province) in the northeastern direction at around 5:30 a.m today," the Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement. "It is estimated to have failed."</p2> <br><br>

<p2>U.S. officials speaking with NBC News say the failed test involved a "short-range, non-nuclear missile" capable of reaching Seoul.</p2> <br><br>

<p2>The attempted launch comes just one day after President Donald Trump, in an interview published by Reuters Thursday, said a "major, major conflict" was possible with North Korea.</p2>
